# Daniel Garcia Mendez | Aspiring Cybersecurity & Penetration Tester

Passionate about offensive security, bug bounties, and building tools that surface real-world vulnerabilities. I blend hands-on technical skills with a research mindset to find, exploit, and help remediate weaknesses before adversaries do.

- 🎓 Computer Science student (University of Houston) with a focus on cybersecurity and penetration testing  
- 🔍 Interests: Vulnerability research, bug bounty hunting, secure software development, adversary emulation  
- 🚀 Currently learning: Red team tooling, threat modeling, advanced network exploitation
